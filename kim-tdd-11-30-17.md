# Kim's TDD Breakout - 11/30/17

## 3 and 1 Observation

3 Things I liked:
  1. Great use of the whiteboard in lieu of TV: Objectives posted & section for 'code'
  2. Very interactive lesson:
    * 3 turn and talks
    * cold-calling
    * prompting student research on vocabulary & documentation
    * students sharing code in slack
  3. Look at code for an actual drill; keeping it relevant to student goals

1 thing I would have done differently:
  I love that you offered to be in the room with students after the breakout as they worked on the drills, but I think it would have been great to model writing one of the tests for that drill before letting them loose (granted, time was running short).

Chai Assertions

.equal(actual, expected)          // equivalent to == comparison operator (type coercion happens)
.notEqual(actual, expected)       // equivalent to != comparison operator (type coercion happens)
.strictEqual(actual, expected)    // equivalent to === comparison operator (no type coercion)
